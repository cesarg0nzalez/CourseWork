#Synopsis
Many severe weather events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage.  Using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), this research suggests tornadoes have caused more harm than other types of weather events.  Floods have caused more economic damage than other weather events. 

#Introduction
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

Storm Data is an official publication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which documents:  

a. The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce; 

b. Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area; and  
c. Other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with another event.   

#Data Processing
The data for this assignment can be downloaded from here:  
[48MB][http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2]

NOTE:  This data was downloaded for this exercise on August 16, 2015.

There are 37 variables included in this dataset. Only a subset of the variables is used for this analysis.  A total of 903,297 records
are in the dataset.

To tidy the data and prepare it for analysis, we need to load a few libraries:

```{r loadLibraries, message=FALSE}
library(Hmisc)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r dataload, eval=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("./data/workingData.csv")) 
     {
     download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2",
                   destfile="../Class5Assign2/data/rawData.csv.bz2")
     file = bzfile('./data/rawData.csv.bz2')
     rawData <- read.csv(file)
     #Let's preserve the raw data and creat a working copy of the dataset
     workingData <- rawData %>% select(BGN_DATE, EVTYPE, FATALITIES, INJURIES,PROPDMG,PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP)
     #Let's save a copy of the working data
     write.csv(workingData, "./data/workingData.csv")
}
```
```{r loadWorkingData}
     workingData <- read.csv("./data/workingData.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
Because weather reporting early in the dataset was inconsistent, we are going to evalaute weather events later than **1995**:
```{r}
workingData$BGN_DATE <- mdy_hms(workingData$BGN_DATE)
workingData <- workingData %>% filter(year(BGN_DATE) > 1995)
# convert to local data frame. Printing only shows 10 rows and as many columns as can fit on your screen
workingData <- tbl_df(workingData)
```
Let's take a look at the data:
```{r}
glimpse(workingData)
```
The dataset contains letters like K, M, and B representing the monetary values of 1,000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000, respectively.  
Let's switch the letters for numbers so we have numerical data to evaluate.  We need to perform this on property and crop  
damage fields.  We'll then multiply the number of events for each level of damage.
```{r makeNumeric, warning=FALSE}
#Property damage
workingData$PROPDMGEXP <- gsub('K', '1000', workingData$PROPDMGEXP)
workingData$PROPDMGEXP <- gsub('M', '1000000', workingData$PROPDMGEXP)
workingData$PROPDMGEXP <- gsub('M', '1000000000', workingData$PROPDMGEXP)
workingData$PROPDMGEXP <- as.numeric(workingData$PROPDMGEXP, na.rm=TRUE)
#Multiply the PROPDMG values with their respective PROPDMGEXP values
workingData$PROPDMG <- workingData$PROPDMG * workingData$PROPDMGEXP

#Crop Damage
workingData$CROPDMGEXP <- gsub('K', '1000', workingData$CROPDMGEXP)
workingData$CROPDMGEXP <- gsub('M', '1000000', workingData$CROPDMGEXP)
workingData$CROPDMGEXP <- gsub('B', '1000000000', workingData$CROPDMGEXP)
workingData$CROPDMGEXP <- as.numeric(workingData$CROPDMGEXP)
#Multiply the CPROPDMG values with their respective CPROPDMGEXP values
workingData$CROPDMG <- workingData$CROPDMG * workingData$CROPDMGEXP
glimpse(workingData)
```
The data is looking pretty good but it needs to be grouped and summarized before plots can be developed.  Using the dplyr package, we manipulate the dataset:
```{r dplyr1}
totals <- workingData %>%  
     group_by(EVTYPE) %>%  
     summarise(FATALITIES = sum(FATALITIES), INJURIES = sum(INJURIES),PROPDMG = sum(PROPDMG, na.rm = TRUE),  
               CROPDMG = sum(CROPDMG, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%  
     mutate(totalDeathInjury=FATALITIES + INJURIES, totalDollarLost= PROPDMG + CROPDMG)  
glimpse(totals)
```
We now have the data needed to evaluate the 2 questions posed in this exercise:

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

#Results

###Question 1: Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

```{r plot1}
totalsPlot <- totals %>% arrange(desc(totalDeathInjury))
totalsPlot1 <- totalsPlot[1:10,]
totalsPlot1 <- totalsPlot1 %>%
     gather(PhysicalHarm, Injuries, FATALITIES:INJURIES)
ggplot(totalsPlot1, aes(x=reorder(EVTYPE, -totalDeathInjury), y=Injuries, fill=PhysicalHarm, order=desc(PhysicalHarm))) + #works
     geom_bar(stat="identity") +
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
     #geom_text(aes(label=totalDeathInjury)) +
     ggtitle(paste("Most Harmful Weather Events ")) +
     xlab("Weather Event") + ylab("Total Deaths and Injuries") +
     theme(legend.position=c(.8,.8))  +
     scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2", labels=c("Fatalities", "Injuries")) + #http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)
     labs(fill="Physical Harm") 
```


For the purposes of this analysis, harm is defined as the sum of deaths and injuries.  As the plot above illustrates, tornadoes have caused more physical harm than other types of weather events. *This answers the first requirement for this course exercise.*

###Question 2: Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

```{r plot2}
totalsPlot <- totals %>% arrange(desc(totalDollarLost))
totalsPlot2 <- totalsPlot[1:10,]
totalsPlot2 <- totalsPlot2 %>%
     gather(dollarHarm, dollarDamage, PROPDMG:CROPDMG)
ggplot(totalsPlot2, aes(x=reorder(EVTYPE, -totalDollarLost), y=dollarDamage/1000000000, fill=dollarHarm, order=desc(dollarHarm))) + #works stacked
     geom_bar(stat="identity") +
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
     #geom_text(aes(label=totalDeathInjury)) +
     ggtitle(paste("Most Costly Weather Events ")) +
     xlab("Weather Event") + ylab("Total Economic Cost - Billions $") +
     theme(legend.position=c(.8,.8))  +
     scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2", labels=c("Property", "Crop")) + #http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)
     labs(fill="Cost") 
```


Floods have caused more economic damage than other weather events. *This answers the second requirement for this course exercise and completes the assignment.*
