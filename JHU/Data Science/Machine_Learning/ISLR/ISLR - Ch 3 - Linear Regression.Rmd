##3.6.2 Simple Linear Regression

The MASS library contains the Boston data set, which records medv (median house value) for 506 neighborhoods around Boston. We will seek to predict medv using 13 predictors such as rm (average number of rooms per house), age (average age of houses), and lstat (percent of households with low socioeconomic status).
```{r}
library(MASS)
library(ISLR)

attach(Boston)
names(Boston)
```
To find out more about the data set, we can type ?Boston.

We will start by using the lm() function to fit a simple linear regression lm() model, with medv as the response and lstat as the predictor. The basic syntax is lm(y∼x,data), where y is the response, x is the predictor, and data is the data set in which these two variables are kept.
```{r}
attach(Boston)
lm.fit = lm(medv~lstat)
```

The command causes an error because R does not know where to find the variables medv and lstat. The next line tells R that the variables are in Boston. If we attach Boston, the first line works fine because R now recognizes the variables.
```{r}
lm.fit =lm(medv∼lstat ,data=Boston )
lm.fit =lm(medv∼lstat)
```
If we type lm.fit, some basic information about the model is output.

For more detailed information, we use summary(lm.fit). This gives us pvalues and standard errors for the coefficients, as well as the R2 statistic and F-statistic for the model.
```{r}
summary(lm.fit)
```

We can use the names() function in order to find out what other pieces of information are stored in lm.fit. Although we can extract these quantitiesby name—e.g. lm.fit$coefficients—it is safer to use the extractor functions like coef() to access them.
```{r}
names(lm.fit )
```

In order to obtain a confidence interval for the coefficient estimates, we can use the confint() command.
```{r}
confint (lm.fit)
```
The predict() function can be used to produce confidence intervals and prediction intervals for the prediction of medv for a given value of lstat.
```{r}
predict(lm.fit, data.frame(lstat =(c(5 ,10 ,15) )), interval ="confidence")
predict(lm.fit, data.frame(lstat =(c(5 ,10 ,15) )), interval ="prediction")
```
For instance, the 95% confidence interval associated with a lstat value of 10 is (24.47, 25.63), and the 95% prediction interval is (12.828, 37.28). As expected, the confidence and prediction intervals are centered around the same point (a predicted value of 25.05 for medv when lstat equals 10), but the latter are substantially wider.

We will now plot medv and lstat along with the least squares regression line using the plot() and abline() functions.
```{r}
plot(lstat ,medv)
abline (lm.fit)
```
There is some evidence for non-linearity in the relationship between lstat and medv. We will explore this issue later in this lab.

The abline() function can be used to draw any line, not just the least squares regression line. To draw a line with intercept a and slope b, we type abline(a,b). Below we experiment with some additional settings for plotting lines and points. The lwd=3 command causes the width of the regression line to be increased by a factor of 3; this works for the plot() and lines() functions also.We can also use the pch option to create different plotting symbols.
```{r}
plot(lstat ,medv)
abline(lm.fit, lwd =3)
abline(lm.fit, lwd = 3, col = "red")
plot(lstat ,medv ,col = "red")
plot(lstat ,medv ,pch = 20)
plot(lstat ,medv ,pch = "+")
plot(1:20, 1:20, pch = 1:20)
```

Next we examine some diagnostic plots, several of which were discussed in Section 3.3.3. Four diagnostic plots are automatically produced by applying the plot() function directly to the output from lm(). In general, this command will produce one plot at a time, and hitting Enter will generate the next plot. However, it is often convenient to view all four plots together. We can achieve this by using the par() function, which tells R to split the display screen into separate panels so that multiple plots can be viewed simultaneously. For example, par(mfrow=c(2,2)) divides the plotting region into a 2 × 2 grid of panels.
```{r}
par(mfrow =c(2,2))
plot(lm.fit)
```
Alternatively, we can compute the residuals from a linear regression fit using the residuals() function. The function rstudent() will return the studentized residuals, and we can use this function to plot the residuals against the fitted values.
```{r}
plot(predict(lm.fit), residuals(lm.fit))
plot(predict(lm.fit), rstudent(lm.fit))
```
On the basis of the residual plots, there is some evidence of non-linearity. Leverage statistics can be computed for any number of predictors using the hatvalues() function.
```{r}
plot(hatvalues (lm.fit ))
which.max (hatvalues (lm.fit))
```
The which.max() function identifies the index of the largest element of a vector. In this case, it tells us which observation has the largest leverage statistic.

##3.6.3 Multiple Linear Regression

In order to fit a multiple linear regression model using least squares, we again use the lm() function. The syntax lm(y∼x1+x2+x3) is used to fit a model with three predictors, x1, x2, and x3. The summary() function now outputs the regression coefficients for all the predictors.
```{r}
lm.fit =lm(medv∼lstat+age ,data=Boston )
summary (lm.fit)
```
The Boston data set contains 13 variables, and so it would be cumbersome to have to type all of these in order to perform a regression using all of the predictors. Instead, we can use the following short-hand:
```{r}
lm.fit = lm(medv∼.,data=Boston)
summary(lm.fit)
```
We can access the individual components of a summary object by name (type ?summary.lm to see what is available). Hence summary(lm.fit) $ r.sq gives us the R2, and summary(lm.fit) $ sigma gives us the RSE. The vif() function, part of the car package, can be used to compute variance inflation factors. Most VIF’s are low to moderate for this data. The car package is not part of the base R installation so it must be downloaded the first time you use it via the install.packages option in R.
```{r}
library (car)
vif(lm.fit)
```
***
A simple way to detect collinearity is to look at the correlation matrix of the predictors. An element of this matrix that is large in absolute value indicates a pair of highly correlated variables, and therefore a collinearity problem in the data. Unfortunately, not all collinearity problems can be detected by inspection of the correlation matrix: it is possible for collinearity to exist between three or more variables even if no pair of variables has a particularly high correlation. We call this situation multicollinearity. Instead of inspecting the correlation matrix, a better way to assess collinearity is to compute the **variance inflation factor (VIF)**. The VIF is the ratio of the variance of β~j~ when fitting the full model divided by the variance of β~j~ if fit on its own. The smallest possible value for VIF is 1, which indicates the complete absence of collinearity. Typically in practice there is a small amount of collinearity among the predictors. As a rule of thumb, a VIF value that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinearity.
***

What if we would like to perform a regression using all of the variables but one? For example, in the above regression output, age has a high p-value. So we may wish to run a regression excluding this predictor. The following syntax results in a regression using all predictors except age.
```{r}
lm.fit1 =lm (medv∼.-age ,data=Boston )
summary(lm.fit1)
```

Alternatively, the update() function can be used.
```{r}
lm.fit1=update (lm.fit , ∼.-age)
```
##3.6.4 Interaction Terms

It is easy to include interaction terms in a linear model using the lm() function. The syntax lstat:black tells R to include an interaction term between lstat and black. The syntax lstat*age simultaneously includes lstat, age, and the interaction term lstat×age as predictors; it is a shorthand for lstat+age+lstat:age.
```{r}
summary (lm(medv∼lstat *age ,data=Boston ))
```
##3.6.5 Non-linear Transformations of the Predictors

The lm() function can also accommodate non-linear transformations of the predictors. For instance, given a predictor X, we can create a predictor X^2 using I(X^2). The function I() is needed since the ^ has a special meaning in a formula; wrapping as we do allows the standard usage in R, which is to raise X to the power 2. We now perform a regression of medv onto lstat and lstat2.
```{r}
lm.fit2=lm(medv∼lstat + I(lstat^2))
summary(lm.fit2)
```
The near-zero p-value associated with the quadratic term suggests that it leads to an improved model. We use the anova() function to further quantify the extent to which the quadratic fit is superior to the linear fit.
```{r}
lm.fit = lm(medv∼lstat)
anova(lm.fit,lm.fit2)
```
Here Model 1 represents the linear submodel containing only one predictor, lstat, while Model 2 corresponds to the larger quadratic model that has two predictors, lstat and lstat2. The anova() function performs a hypothesis test comparing the two models. The null hypothesis is that the two models fit the data equally well, and the alternative hypothesis is that the full model is superior. Here the F-statistic is 135 and the associated p-value is virtually zero. This provides very clear evidence that the model containing the predictors lstat and lstat2 is far superior to the model that only contains the predictor lstat. This is not surprising, since earlier we saw evidence for non-linearity in the relationship between medv and lstat. If we type
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm.fit2)
```

then we see that when the lstat2 term is included in the model, there is little discernible pattern in the residuals.

In order to create a cubic fit, we can include a predictor of the form I(X^3). However, this approach can start to get cumbersome for higher order polynomials. A better approach involves using the poly() function to create the polynomial within lm(). For example, the following command produces a fifth-order polynomial fit:
```{r}
lm.fit5 = lm(medv∼poly(lstat,5))
summary(lm.fit5)
```
This suggests that including additional polynomial terms, up to fifth order, leads to an improvement in the model fit! However, further investigation of the data reveals that no polynomial terms beyond fifth order have significant p-values in a regression fit. Of course, we are in no way restricted to using polynomial transformations of the predictors. Here we try a log transformation.
```{r}
summary(lm(medv∼log(rm), data=Boston))
```

###3.6.6 Qualitative Predictors

We will now examine the Carseats data, which is part of the ISLR library. We will attempt to predict Sales (child car seat sales) in 400 locations based on a number of predictors.
```{r}
attach(Carseats)
names(Carseats)
```

The Carseats data includes qualitative predictors such as Shelveloc, an indicator of the quality of the shelving location—that is, the space within a store in which the car seat is displayed—at each location. The predictor Shelveloc takes on three possible values, *Bad*, *Medium*, and *Good*.

Given a qualitative variable such as Shelveloc, R generates dummy variables automatically. Below we fit a multiple regression model that includes some interaction terms.
```{r}
lm.fit = lm(Sales∼.+ Income:Advertising + Price:Age, data = Carseats)
summary(lm.fit)
```
The contrasts() function returns the coding that R uses for the dummy variables.
```{r}
attach(Carseats)
contrasts(ShelveLoc)
```
Use ?contrasts to learn about other contrasts, and how to set them.

R has created a ShelveLocGood dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the shelving location is good, and 0 otherwise. It has also created a ShelveLocMedium dummy variable that equals 1 if the shelving location is medium, and 0 otherwise. A bad shelving location corresponds to a zero for each of the two dummy variables. The fact that the coefficient for ShelveLocGood in the regression output is positive indicates that a good shelving location is associated with high sales (relative to a bad location). And ShelveLocMedium has a smaller positive coefficient, indicating that a medium shelving location leads to higher sales than a bad shelving location but lower sales than a good shelving location.
