title: "Calculate Leave-One-Out Prediction for GLM"
output: html_document

In the model development, the “leave-one-out” prediction is a way of cross-validation, calculated as below:

1. First of all, after a model is developed, each observation used in the model development is removed in turn and then the model is refitted with the remaining observations
2. The out-of-sample prediction for the refitted model is calculated with the removed observation one by one to assemble the LOO, e.g. leave-one-out predicted values for the whole model development sample.
The loo_predict() function below is a general routine to calculate the LOO prediction for any GLM object, which can be further employed to investigate the model stability and predictability.
```{r}
pkgs <- c('doParallel', 'foreach')
lapply(pkgs, require, character.only = T)
```
```{r}
#registerDoParallel(cores = 8)

data(AutoCollision, package = "insuranceData")
# A GAMMA GLM #
model1 <- glm(Severity ~ Age + Vehicle_Use, data = AutoCollision, family = Gamma(link = "log"))
# A POISSON GLM #
model2 <- glm(Claim_Count ~ Age + Vehicle_Use, data = AutoCollision, family = poisson(link = "log"))

loo_predict <- function(obj) {
+   yhat <- foreach(i = 1:nrow(obj$data), .combine = rbind) %dopar% {
+     predict(update(obj, data = obj$data[-i, ]), obj$data[i,], type = "response")
+   }
+   return(data.frame(result = yhat[, 1], row.names = NULL))
+ }
# TEST CASE 1
test1 <- loo_predict(model1)
test1$result

# TEST CASE 2
test2 <- loo_predict(model2)
test2$result
