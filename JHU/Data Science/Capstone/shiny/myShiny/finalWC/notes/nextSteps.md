# Next Steps

##Other Concpets to Consider

While my application does OK predicting the next word, there are many opportunities to significantly improve upon the accuracy and the user experience.  Given unlimited time, I would love to do more.  Here are some of the improvements I wish I could implement.  (The Capstone Course is time bound and developing a minimal viable product to get a really good grade had a higher priority than creating the best solution.  A fact of life. . . .)

- Collect data from more varied sources.  (The Capstone Project directed the use of selected news, blogs and Twitter text data)
- Significantly increase not only the type of resources and the size of the resources.  This include finding ways to maintain performance while using much larger data sources
- Implement a type-ahead JavaScript library to auto-complete the word being typed in by the user
- Add spell checking to the application
- Implement different data science algorithms to improve accuracy.  Wouldn't it be cool to try some unsupervised machine learning algorithms?
- Develop the code to predict the next word by first identifying the last word entered by the user and knowing whether it was a noun, pronoun, verb, etc. to better predict the next word
