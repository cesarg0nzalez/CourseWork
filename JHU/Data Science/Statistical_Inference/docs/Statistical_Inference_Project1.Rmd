##Overview

The goal of this exercise is to investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central
Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is
the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also
1/lambda.

According to the central limit theorem distribution of $\bar{x}$ is approximately normal. The approximation can be poor if the sample size is small, but it improves with larger sample sizes. In absence of identified clear outliers, the distribution of the sample mean, is  approximated by a normal model $\bar{x}_{n}$ ~ $N(\mu, \frac{\sigma }{\sqrt{n}})$.

In order to accomplish this exercise we take $\lambda$ = 0.2 and the exercise will be conducted on 10,000 simulations.

##Comparison of Sample & Theoretical Means of the Distribution

In the following we will draw 10,000 samples of size 40 from an $Exp(\frac{1}{0.2}, \frac{1}{0.2})$ distribution. For each of the 10,000 samples we will calculate the mean. Theoretically, this the same as drawing a single sample of size 10,000 from the corresponding sampling distribution with $N(\frac{1}{0.2}, \frac{\frac{1}{0.2}}{\sqrt{40}})$.

```{r simulated_avg_of_40_exponentials, echo=TRUE}
# load  library for graphing
library(ggplot2)

# Parameters for simulation
lambda <- 0.2 # lambda
n <- 40 # sample size
nSimulations <- 10000 # number of simulations

# To ensure reproducibility
set.seed(500)

#Run test to calculate mean
meanData <- matrix(data=rexp(n*nSimulations,lambda),nrow=nSimulations)
meanData_df <- data.frame(means=apply(meanData, 1, mean))
# Average Sample Mean of 10,000 Simulations
meanSample <- mean(meanData_df$means)
```

The sample mean (meanSample) returns `r meanSample` and the theoretical mean ($\mu= \frac{1}{\lambda}$ ) is `r 1/lambda`.  *This answers the first question in the Peer Review Questionaire.*

>  Conclusion: As expected the sample mean from the simulations is close to the theoretical mean.

##Comparison of Sample Variance to the Theoretical Variance

 The theoretical variance is calculated as square of the standard deviation or calculated as
 $\sigma = \frac{1/\lambda}{\sqrt{n}}$,
 $Var = \sigma^2$
```{r sample and theoretical variacne comparison, echo=TRUE}
sampleVariance <- var(meanData_df$means) # Sample variance
theoreticalVariance <- (1/lambda)^2/n # theoretical variance
```

*The conclusion below answers the second question in the Peer Review Questionaire.*

>  Conclusion: The calculated Sample Variance (`r sampleVariance`) and the theoretical variance `r theoreticalVariance` are close. Minor differences possible because the variance is square of standard deviation and small differences may be magnified.

##Investigating Normality of the Distribution

To investigate the normality of the sample distribution with 10,000 simulated sample means a histogram is plotted and overlayed with the density function from the theoretical sampling which is $N(\frac{1}{0.2}, \frac{\frac{1}{0.2}}{\sqrt{40}})$ distributed. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#plot the means
mu <- 1/lambda
sd <- 1/lambda/sqrt(n)
# plot the histogram of averages
hist(meanData_df$means, breaks=50, prob=TRUE,
     main="Distribution of Sampling Average",
     xlab="")
# density of the averages of samples
lines(density(meanData_df$means))
# theoretical center of distribution
abline(v=1/lambda, col="blue")
# theoretical density of the averages of samples
xfit <- seq(min(meanData_df$means), max(meanData_df$means), length=100)
yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean=mu, sd = sd)
lines(xfit, yfit, pch=22, col="blue", lty=2)
# add legend
legend('topright', c("Simulated", "Theoretical"), lty=c(1,2), col=c("black", "blue"))
```

>  Conclusion: It can be reasonably inferred the distribution of means of randomly sampled exponential distributions overlap with the normal distribution of expected values based on $\lambda$. Therefore, it can be considered approximately normal.
